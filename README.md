# F20GP-Coursework-1
Coursework 1 for F20FP Games Programming

I've attempted to recover and recreate as many of the scripts that I can after the Git issue.
The following are files that I know are still missing:
- MouseLook.cs => This was attached to MainCamera and allowed you to look and turn freely with the mouse.
- Bullet.cs => Attached to a bullet prefab and triggered an AttackCollisionTrigger

Please email me at ds86'at'hw(dot)ac(dot)uk if you have any questions, thanks!
